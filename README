Server Selection Plugin

This plugin creates a list of servers by polling Chef periodically (every 5 minutes) for nodes with tags specified under the global configuration page.
When a job is built, a server is picked from the appropriate list and assigned to the job. The name of the server is injected into the build environment as 'TARGET'

Knife commands to add tag:
knife tag create SERVERNAME TAG

Knife command to delete tag:
knife tag delete SERVERNAME TAG

Knife command used to get servers:
knife search tags:TAG -i
